# History

Established in 2018.

Since opening our doors in June, we are getting more and more merchandise everyday! We now offer a free comic saver's program for our customers, run Friday Night Magic and other Magic The Gathering events, and a D&D Adventurers League at our store. We have an open gaming area where you can join one of our gaming events or simply drop by and play a game.
